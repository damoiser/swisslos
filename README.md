## Make me millionare

Just for playing - taking the stats of all numbers played by the [Swisslotto](https://www.swisslos.ch/) and returns the stats by number.

It doesn't take  in consideration the differents probs when the amount of the selectable numbers have changed with the time and it doesn't take in consideration that in the same lottery other numbers are already taken out (the prob changes when a number is already taken) - it can be improved ;-)
